# BreakGuard - Your Health Guardian

**Enforce healthy work breaks with unbreakable discipline.**

BreakGuard is a Windows application that forces you to take regular breaks during long working hours. It locks your screen, controls your monitor via IoT, and requires secure two-factor authentication to unlock — making it impossible to skip breaks.

Perfect for developers, designers, remote workers, and anyone who works 10+ hours continuously and struggles with self-discipline.
---

## Why BreakGuard?

**The Problem:** You know breaks are important, but willpower fails when deadlines loom. Notifications get dismissed. Timers get ignored. Your health suffers.

**The Solution:** BreakGuard doesn't ask — it enforces.

### Key Features

- **Beautiful Modern UI** - PyQt6 interface with Material Design
- **Automatic Lock** - Screen locks after your configured work interval
- **Two-Factor Unlock** - Google Authenticator (6-digit OTP) + Face verification
- **Monitor Control** - Turns off monitor via Tinxy IoT API
- **Survives Reboots** - Auto-starts with Windows, enforces breaks even after restart
- **Anti-Bypass** - Blocks Alt+Tab, Alt+F4, Task Manager during lock
- **Builds Habits** - Consistent enforcement creates lasting behavior change
- **Configurable** - Set your own work/break intervals

## How It Works

```
1. Install & Setup (one-time)
   ├─ Run setup wizard
   ├─ Set work interval (e.g., 60 minutes)
   ├─ Scan QR with Google Authenticator
   ├─ Register your face (optional)
   └─ Configure Tinxy IoT (optional)

2. BreakGuard Runs in Background
   ├─ System tray icon shows status
   ├─ Timer counts down work interval
   └─ Auto-starts with Windows

3. Break Time Arrives
   ├─ Warning notification (5 mins before)
   ├─ Monitor turns off (via Tinxy)
   ├─ Fullscreen lock appears
   └─ No way to skip or dismiss

4. Unlock Process
   ├─ Enter 6-digit code from Google Authenticator
   ├─ Face verification via camera
   └─ Unlock granted, work timer restarts
```

## Who Needs This?

### Perfect For:
- **Software Developers** - Long coding sessions
- **Designers** - Hours in Photoshop/Figma
- **Data Analysts** - Extended spreadsheet work
- **Writers & Content Creators** - Marathon writing sessions
- **Students** - Study marathons
- **Remote Workers** - No office structure

### You Need BreakGuard If You:
- Work 8-15+ hours continuously
- Ignore break reminders regularly
- Suffer from eye strain or back pain
- Skip meals or bathroom breaks
- Feel guilty taking breaks
- Have poor self-discipline for health habits

## Security & Authentication

### Two-Factor Unlock System

**Step 1: Google Authenticator (TOTP)**
- Industry-standard Time-based One-Time Password
- Works 100% offline (no internet needed)
- 6-digit code changes every 30 seconds
- Same tech banks use for 2FA

**Step 2: Face Verification**
- Uses your webcam
- Offline face matching (OpenCV)
- Data never leaves your computer
- Optional but recommended

### Anti-Bypass Features

- **Keyboard blocking** - Alt+Tab, Alt+F4, Win+D disabled
- **Task Manager auto-close** - Can't kill the process easily
- **Fullscreen always-on-top** - Covers all windows
- **Monitor control** - Physical screen turns off via IoT
- **Survives restart** - Lock persists after reboot

> **Note:** BreakGuard is designed for self-discipline, not military-grade security. Advanced users can bypass via Safe Mode or external boot — this is intentional. The goal is habit formation, not imprisonment.

## Monitor Control (Tinxy IoT)

BreakGuard integrates with **Tinxy** smart switches to physically control your monitor power.

### What is Tinxy?
- IoT smart switch platform (https://tinxyapi.pages.dev/)
- Controls devices via REST API
- Plug your monitor into Tinxy switch
- BreakGuard turns it OFF during breaks
- Monitor stays off until unlock complete

### Setup Tinxy (Optional)
1. Get Tinxy smart switch from https://tinxy.in/
2. Install Tinxy mobile app
3. Add your monitor switch to app
4. Get API token from app settings
5. Enter in BreakGuard setup wizard

> **Tinxy is optional** - BreakGuard works fine without it using software monitor control

   - **Step 2:** Face verification via webcam
   - If both pass: Unlock granted
   - If either fails: Stays locked, try again

6. **After Unlock**
   - Work timer resets and restarts
   - Back to normal desktop
   - Cycle repeats

### System Tray Menu

```
BreakGuard
  ├─ Active (18 min remaining)
  ├─ Quick Settings
  ├─ Pause Timer
  ├─ Settings
  ├─ Debug Info
  ├─ Run Setup Again
  ├─ Skip Current Break
  └─ Exit BreakGuard
```

### Google Authenticator Setup

1. **First Time (Setup Wizard)**
   - BreakGuard shows QR code on screen
   - Open Google Authenticator app on phone
   - Tap "+" button
   - Select "Scan QR code"
   - Point camera at BreakGuard QR code
   - Account "BreakGuard" added to app

2. **During Lock Screen**
   - Open Google Authenticator app
   - Find "BreakGuard" entry
   - See 6-digit code (changes every 30 seconds)
   - Enter code in lock screen

**Tip:** Write down the secret key shown during setup in case you lose your phone!

### Face Registration

1. **During Setup Wizard**
   - Click "Register Face"
   - Camera preview appears
   - Position face in frame
   - Look straight at camera
   - Click "Capture" (5-10 photos recommended)
   - System saves your face encoding

2. **During Lock Screen**
   - After entering TOTP code
   - Camera activates automatically
   - Look at camera for 2-3 seconds
   - System matches face
   - Unlock granted if match successful

**Privacy:** Face data is stored locally in encrypted format, never uploaded anywhere.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem:** `pip install` fails
- **Solution:** Make sure Python is added to PATH
- **Solution:** Run as Administrator
- **Solution:** Try: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Problem:** "Python not recognized"
- **Solution:** Reinstall Python, check "Add to PATH"
- **Solution:** Restart terminal/computer after install

### Setup Wizard Issues

**Problem:** QR code not showing
- **Solution:** Install pillow: `pip install pillow`
- **Solution:** Check console for errors
- **Solution:** Manually enter secret key in Google Authenticator

**Problem:** Camera not working
- **Solution:** Grant camera permissions in Windows Settings
- **Solution:** Close other apps using camera (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- **Solution:** Try different USB camera
- **Solution:** Skip face verification (TOTP still works)

**Problem:** 6 OTP input boxes not showing
- **Solution:** This is a known PyQt6 styling issue
- **Solution:** Clear Python cache: Delete `src/__pycache__` folder
- **Solution:** Restart application

### Lock Screen Issues

**Problem:** Can't unlock even with correct code
- **Solution:** Check code hasn't expired (30 sec window)
- **Solution:** Sync phone time with internet
- **Solution:** Try next code that appears
- **Solution:** Check caps lock is off

**Problem:** Face verification keeps failing
- **Solution:** Ensure good lighting
- **Solution:** Remove glasses/hat if not worn during registration
- **Solution:** Re-register face in better lighting
- **Solution:** Disable face verification temporarily in config.json

**Problem:** Lock screen won't appear
- **Solution:** Check BreakGuard is running (system tray icon)
- **Solution:** Check work interval in config.json
- **Solution:** View logs for errors
- **Solution:** Restart BreakGuard

### Tinxy Issues

**Problem:** Monitor not turning off
- **Solution:** Verify Tinxy API token is correct
- **Solution:** Check device ID in config.json
- **Solution:** Test Tinxy in their app first
- **Solution:** Check internet connection
- **Solution:** BreakGuard works without Tinxy (software-only lock)

### Auto-Start Issues

**Problem:** BreakGuard doesn't start with Windows
- **Solution:** Run setup wizard again
- **Solution:** Manually add to Task Scheduler
- **Solution:** Check `auto_start_windows` in config.json
- **Solution:** Run app as Administrator once

### Emergency Bypass

If you're truly stuck and need to bypass:

1. **Restart in Safe Mode** (F8 during boot)
2. **Boot from USB** with another OS
3. **Edit config.json** from another account
4. **Delete BreakGuard folder** (defeats the purpose!)

> **Remember:** The goal is building discipline. If you bypass too often, BreakGuard won't help you.

## Philosophy

> "If willpower was enough, reminders would work.  
> BreakGuard exists because discipline needs structure.  
> Health isn't negotiable - enforce it."

BreakGuard is not about punishment. It's about **protecting yourself from yourself**. It's about building sustainable work habits that prevent burnout, preserve your eyesight, and keep your body healthy for the long term.

We work in an industry where 12-hour days are normalized. Where skipping meals is a badge of honor. Where back pain and eye strain are accepted as inevitable.

**BreakGuard says: Not anymore.**
